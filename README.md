# ICARDA Genebank Bioinformatics Workshops and Training

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the ICARDA Genebank Bioinformatics Workshops and Training Programs. This repository is dedicated to sharing information, resources, and materials from our workshops and training sessions aimed at enhancing bioinformatics capabilities and supporting agricultural research in dry areas around the world.

## About ICARDA Genebank

The ICARDA Genebank plays a vital role in conserving genetic resources and supporting breeding programs to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Our bioinformatics workshops and training programs are designed to empower researchers and practitioners with the skills and knowledge needed to leverage genetic data for crop improvement and conservation.

**This repository is part of Dr. Zakaria Kehelâ€™s research lab. Dr. Zakaria Kehel is a genetic resources scientist.**
